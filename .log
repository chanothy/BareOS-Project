  Creates filesystem: OK
  Mounts filesystem:  OK

Create Tests:
  Returns error if directory is full:            OK
  Returns error if filename exists in directory: OK
  Returns error if no blocks remain for file:    OK

  Sets inode index to a directory entry:         FAIL - Second inode block number does not match expected block number
  Marks inode as used in bitmask:                FAIL - Freemask was not updated to reflect second requested inode
  Saves changes back to the blockstore:          FAIL - inode block does not contain the correct ID value

Open Tests:
  Returns error if file is already open:    OK
  Returns error if the file does not exist: OK
  Adds file to the open file table:         FAIL - oft entry does not point to correct directory entry
